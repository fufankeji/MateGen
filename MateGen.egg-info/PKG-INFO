## What is MateGen?

**MateGen is an Interactive Intelligent Programming Assistant developed by the Jiutian Teacher's Large Model Research Team. It can be conveniently used within the Jupyter coding environment to assist users in efficiently completing tasks related to intelligent data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and large model development. MateGen also offers customizable knowledge bases and extendable functionalities to meet the specific needs of users.**

The basic features of MateGen are as follows:

- 🤖 **High Usability, Zero Threshold**: MateGen provides online large model application services for users, enabling one-click installation and initiation of interactions without any hardware or network proxy barriers.
- 🚀 **Robust High-Precision RAG System**: Synchronize local documents with one click and conduct RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) searches and Q&A. MateGen supports the retrieval of up to 1000 documents and 10GB of document content, providing high-precision Q&A for mainstream document formats such as md, ppt, word, and pdf. It efficiently handles functions like massive document summarization, needle-in-a-haystack content testing, and sentiment analysis Q&A. MateGen can automatically determine whether RAG search is required based on user queries.
- 🏅 **Local Python Code Interpreter**: Connect to the user's local Python environment to complete programming tasks, including data cleaning, data visualization, machine learning, deep learning, and large model development. It supports learning the code repository before programming, debugging based on actual scenarios, and automatically uploading visualized images to image hosting services.
- 🚩 **High-Precision NL2SQL Functionality**: Generate SQL queries based on user needs and connect to the local MySQL environment for automatic execution and debugging. It also supports retrieving data dictionaries and enterprise data knowledge bases before writing SQL queries, thereby improving SQL accuracy.
- 🛩️ **Visual and Networking Capabilities**: Enable MateGen's visual capabilities by inputting image URLs during conversations to recognize image content. MateGen also has networking capabilities to automatically initiate search-based Q&A when encountering questions it cannot answer.
- 🚅 **Unlimited Conversation Context**: MateGen supports unlimited conversation length, managing the density of unknown information in historical dialogues to save tokens while maintaining an infinite conversation context.

Additionally, MateGen boasts **high stability** and **high availability**, supports **Multi Function calling** (one task triggering multiple functions) and **Parallel Function calling** (one function initiating multiple executors), can **automatically decompose complex tasks**, **auto-debug**, and possesses a certain degree of **autonomous awareness**. It can **review its own actions** and deeply **explore user intentions**.

## MateGen API-KEY Acquisition

MateGen is currently available only as an online service, utilizing large models to deliver various services without the need for local hardware or network environment requirements, enabling zero-threshold usage. **To use MateGen, an API-KEY is required for authentication**. During the testing phase, a limited **3 billion free token quota** is available, distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. For API-KEY acquisition, joining the technical support group, or any other inquiries, <span style="color:red;">please scan the QR code to add our friendly customer service representative on WeChat (ID: littlelion_1215) and reply with "MG" for more details👇</span>.

## MateGen Installation and Deployment Process

​	MateGen is lightweight and easy to call. It can be installed directly using pip, and its invocation style is similar to sklearn. By instantiating a MateGen agent, you can start interacting right away!

- **MateGen Download Method**

  MateGen is now available on the PyPI platform and can be installed directly via `pip install mategen`. Note that MateGen requires many dependencies to run, so it is recommended to use a virtual environment for installation. First, create a virtual environment named `mategen`:

  ```python
  conda create -n mategen python=3.8
  ```

  Then activate the virtual environment with the following command:

  ```python
  conda activate mategen
  ```

  Next, install MateGen in the virtual environment:
  
  ```python
  pip install mategen
  ```
  
  After installation, considering the need to invoke MateGen in Jupyter, we need to install the IPython Kernel in the virtual environment:
  
  ```python
  pip install ipykernel
  ```
  
  Add this virtual environment to Jupyter's Kernel list:
  
  ```python
  python -m ipykernel install --user --name mategen --display-name "mategen"
  ```
  
  Then start the Jupyter service:
  
  ```python
  jupyter lab
  ```
  
  Select the mategen kernel in Jupyter to enter the corresponding virtual environment and run MateGen:

- **MateGen Invocation Method**

  Invoking MateGen is very simple. Just import it in the code environment and input a valid API-KEY to start interacting!

  ```python
  mategen = MateGenClass(api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY')
  ```

  Then you can use the chat function for single or multi-turn conversations:

  ```python
  mategen.chat("你好，很高兴见到你！")
  ```

  ```markdown
  ▌ MateGen初始化完成，欢迎使用！
  
  你好！很高兴见到你！有什么我可以帮助你的吗？
  ```
